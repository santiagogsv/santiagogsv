## About Me
I'm an adaptable Data Analyst fluent in English, Spanish, and Italian, with a robust background in economics. Based in New York City, I specialize in Python and Rust for data analysis and networking, leveraging modern technologies to improve web performance and data processing. My toolkit includes extensive use of Python for data-driven insights and Rust for high-performance networking, with a keen interest in Cloudflare's innovative use of Rust to enhance web infrastructure.

## Python and Data Analysis Skills
- **Python Libraries:** 
  - **Polars & Numpy:** Utilize for data manipulation and numerical analysis to clean and prepare large datasets.
  - **Matplotlib & Statsmodels:** Employ for data visualization and statistical modeling to uncover trends and patterns.
- **Machine Learning with Python:**
  - **Scikit-learn:** Implement machine learning algorithms for predictive modeling.
  - **PyTorch:** Use for building and training advanced neural network models.
- **Data Management:** 
  - **SQL:** Manage databases efficiently.
  - **Excel:** Utilize for additional data processing and visualization.

## Rust for Networking and Performance
- **Rust Libraries:**
  - **Axum:** Leverage for creating high-performance web applications and APIs with ease.
  - **Tokio:** Use for asynchronous programming to handle multithreaded network operations efficiently.
  - **WASM (WebAssembly):** Explore for compiling Rust to WASM, enabling high-performance, low-level operations in web environments.
- **Rust in Data and ML:**
  - **Polars:** Use for data processing in Rust, similar to how it's used in Python, for fast data manipulation.
  - **Burn:** Experiment with this Rust library for machine learning, aiming to bring Python's ML capabilities into Rust's performance ecosystem.

## TypeScript for Frontend Development
- **TypeScript:** 
  - Employ for type-safe frontend development, enhancing scalability and maintainability of web applications.
  - Integrate with React or Qwik for dynamic, data-driven UIs.

## Education
**Bachelor of Science in Economics** | UNAM (2018 - 2023)
- Applied advanced statistical techniques and Python programming to model and analyze economic data.
